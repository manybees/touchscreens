				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>For this page I was told to use grid as a layout method. I gotta say,
					starting out was really hard and confusing but once I understood the system
				 	I was able to get it all to work. I actually like this more than flexbox.
					Flexbox is more responsive but grid is more precise for layout purposes.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p><li> The hardest part of this page was understanding how the grid layout system worked.
						<li> I learned that the two most important elements for grid boxes is grid-template-columns and
					  grid-template-rows. I learned that you need to use both at all times, even if you
						have only one row or one column.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p><li>Just like flexbox, my blocks were evenly spaced and aligned and I didn thave to worry
						about positioning or adjusting widths. I actually learned that in order for the grid system
						to work the block inside of the grid block needs to have no set width. I found the
						percentage system works really well.
						<li>Grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows are what created the sizes of my blocks.
						<li>I really like the way this looks, now I am curious if I can combine grid with flex
						wrapping to make it more adjustable and responsive.</p>
